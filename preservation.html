        <h1>Preservation</h1>
        <p>What will the post-internet generation cherish? ðŸ“¸</p>
        <div class="imgtext">

        <p>I often hear from people in Gen X that they don't remember what life was like before the internet. This is fair. The internet has changed so much about our lives and how we live it, that all of the little tweaks we've made assemble to form an avalanche of productivity greater than the sum of its parts.</p>
        <p>Since the advent of digital camcorders, we can capture a TON of our lives daily. Smartphones having better and better cameras year over year affirms this too. Memory is so cheap nowadays that you might as well take out your phone and record that concert or vacation while you're there. Worst case you just delete it later...</p>
        <p>In Week Two, we read the <a href="src/broadening-the-appeal.pdf" target="_blank">History of the Information Machine</a>. In the latter half, the authors speak on the CD-ROM.</p>
        <div class="quoted">
            <p>"Although CD-ROM drives were expensive upon their introduction, costing $1,000 or more for several years, their huge capacity gave them the potential to create an entirely new market for computer-enabled content that the embryonic computer networks would not be able to satisfy for another fifteen years."</p>
        </div>
        <p>The sheer capacity of data that computers can store has been a consistent selling point since they've been invented. Why buy a dictionary when you can just store it on a floppy disk weighing less than half as much?</p>
        <p>If that was true back in the 80s, you bet it's true now.</p>
        <p>But, it begs the question of whether we <strong>should</strong> store. Is it really ethical to record Johnny's mishap at the party last Saturday? Should you keep the recording of Sarah's presentation even though she made so many clerical errors? Where is the line?</p>
        <p>Like most ethical dilemmas, it doesn't exist. Not only this, but it is sparsely legislated.<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> This creates a clear divide between the generations that grew up with technology and those who didn't. Instead of relying on shaky recollections or handwritten notes, computers can store the nuances to a T.</p>
        <p>So what will our generation hold on to? Cat photos, or war footage in palestine? It's tough to know, but what I can say is this superhuman memory that technology affords <strong>will</strong> have a downstream effect on how we live out our lives. Staying on edge, and on our toes.</p>
