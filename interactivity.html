        <p>When you think of interactivity, I know the first thing that comes to mind is this overall-wearing plumber. He's iconic and represents how highly interactive and responsive video games can be. But interactivity goes <strong>way</strong> beyond video games.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Museum Displays</li>
            <li>Social Media</li>
            <li>ChatBots</li>
        </ol>
        <p>All of these things are completely operated by their user or user(s). That's pretty powerful when it comes to getting people hooked.</p>
        <p>Personally, I was not a TV or movie watcher growing up. Sure, I watched kids shows like Phineas and Ferb, but I never really watched mainstream shows on Netflix and Max.</p>
        <p>I think this is because the interactivity of the internet growing up. I was an early YouTube kid, watching The Yogscast and AntVenom before Minecraft was "cool". I loved how tied in they were to their communities. Obviously there's a parasocial aspect to that, but I didn't really pay it much mind as a 9 year old.</p>
