        <h1>Interactivity</h1>
        <p>Beep Boop ðŸ¤–.</p>

        <p>When you think of interactivity, I know the first thing that comes to mind is this overall-wearing plumber. He's iconic and represents how highly interactive and responsive video games can be. But interactivity goes <strong>way</strong> beyond video games.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Museum Displays
                <p>There are entire companies that exist to create content for museums and education (See <a href="https://www.cortinaproductions.com/" target="_blank">Cortina Productions</a>). The content <strong>needs</strong> to be fun to play with, because if your audience is bored they're just going to move on to something else and miss the point you're making entirely.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Social Media
                <p>The whole point of social media is interacting with others through your interactions with the technology. The underlying algorithms are abstracted away to get you a streamlined view of what is going on around you. Through commenting and liking, the app encourages you to spend time engaging with the content you're served.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Chatbots
                <p>ChatGPT, Bard, Bing, they all look to accomplish a common goal, speak so naturally that their customer may as well be talking to another human being. Because of this, they need to focus heavily on natural language and concise language. Too robotic, and people will just switch to a search engine. Too verbose, and the user will either give up, ask for a summary, ...or move to a search engine again. Only one of those keeps you using the service, so these bots are programmed accordingly.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Technology is a unique medium in that it affords new paradigms of interactivity for creatives. In Week 6, we read about JPEGs in an <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com./technology/archive/2013/09/what-is-a-jpeg-the-invisible-object-you-see-every-day/279954/" target="_blank">this article</a> from The Atlantic. JPEG compression is interesting because while it's underscored by difficult discrete math, the people who rely on it the most are those who aren't in those rigidly technical fields.</p>
        <p>Photographers and Illustrators alike rely on the space savings of JPEGs to be able to share their work at all. Raw image data is <strong>expensive</strong>.</p>
        <p> If Instagram had to keep all 40 billion+ of their photos and videos in a raw format, they would be trying to store as many bytes as there are atoms in the observable universe.<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> E-Books would be text only, because if they weren't, they would be unreasonably large to store on your average layperson's computer. Images would be a luxury, a mere show of opulence.</p>
        <p>So be grateful for the mathematicians that made your daily Twitter scroll session possible. Without them, you'd be looking at a wall of black text.</p>
