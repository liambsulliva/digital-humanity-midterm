        <p>Ever since its inception in the late 20th century, the internet has never really been great at keeping things private. We've definitely tried (and failed) to make sure that artists get fair credit for their work. The first step was instituting copyright law, which to its credit, does a damn good job. Being legally threatened is something that is almost always scary whether it's through the internet or not.</p>
        <h2>Torrenting ðŸ˜ˆ</h2>
        <p>So people do what they do, steal as much as they possibly can. Can you blame them? They've learned over time that the internet is simply too big to be policed well.</p>
