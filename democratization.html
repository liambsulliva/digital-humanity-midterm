        <p>Ever since its inception in the late 20th century, the internet has never really been great at keeping things private. In Week 7, we read up on <a href="src/panopticon.pdf" target="_blank">Panopticism</a>, the idea that modern society uses surveillance and control to maintain order and discipline.</p>
        <p>This definitely exists, and I poked fun of it in my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NigabR6lLlE" target="_blank">video response</a>. FAANG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google) own a lion's share of the internet, and fully take advantage of it to exploit user privacy and collect information discreetly. Google Chrome picks up data from the sites you visit, logs your bookmarks, and records your voice. Meta uses Facebook browsing data to issue targeted advertising. Digital surveillance is everywhere.</p>
        <p>With that said, i'd like to flip Panopticism on its head. Let's focus on the little loopholes people discover, because the stories of people skirting regulations in the past are enshrined in internet culture today.</p>
        <h2>Torrenting ðŸ˜ˆ</h2>
        <p>Have you heard of Napster? Depending on when you were born, this may be a blast from the past, or you may be scratching your head wondering what the hell I'm talking about.</p>
        <p>Napster was a file sharing service that allowed people to share MP3s with one another ""legally"" through peer-to-peer torrents. This isn't anything new, but Napster was special in how widely adopted it was. At its peak, 80 million people looked to Napster to get their music.<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> Basically every rip of CDs and Vinyl was just available on the internet to download. You could make the argument that this is how streaming services got their start, considering that Napster eventually sold to Rhapsody.<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup></p>
        <p>The reason this even worked is through the democratization of information the internet affords.</p>
        <p>Whenever something is shared on the internet, it's there forever. Even if you choose to take something down, it can always be downloaded and reshared after the fact. If something is leaked, god knows it'll be shared around a thousand times before word comes around to the creator. This makes sharing work online really dangerous. Whether you're a small artist on twitter trying to make a couple bucks off of commissions, or a mega corporation buying and selling licenses, it affects both the same.</p>
        <p>So it's important to remember this quality whenever you're sharing work. Anything that you put out into the world tends to stay there.</p>
