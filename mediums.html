        <p>Modern day computing affords a lot of mediums for artists to choose from. Whether you're a Photographer (like me!), Graphic Designer, or Illustrator, there are a lot of mainstream tools available that are easy to pick up and run. Here's a list of my favorites.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Photoshop
                <p>I'm going to be incredibly biased here as a photographer, but photoshop is the industry standard of creative software for a reason. It's like a toolbox. You're not supposed to use absolutely everything in it, but as long as you know what you need, you're all set.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Lightroom
                <p>This is my primary software for editing. I may export to photoshop for final tweaks, but Lightroom Classic is where I move the adjustment sliders.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Illustrator
                <p>The 3rd Musketeer of Adobe, Illustrator is good for professionals in digital painting and brushwork. They give ample options to digital artists, with brushes galore and all sorts of different options to toggle for brush size and shape.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Capture One
                <p>Like Lightroom, but a little more feature dense. They have detailed knobs for tuning color grading and sharpness sliders. This app is definitely aimed more at professionals.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Procreate
                <p>Procreate is like illustrator, but aimed towards the casual/freelance crowd. It's designed for iPad, so a lot of people can just download it and pick it up. </p>
            </li>
            <li>Paint
                <p>The OG. The Best. When someone pulls out MS-PAINT to explain you something, you know they're serious. They're passionate, and if you don't listen to them, they'll call you out for it. I hope to be on that level some day...</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
